npm install
npm run build
```

### Test Build Locally
```bash
npm run build
npx serve out
```
Then open http://localhost:3000

### Audio Not Playing
- Modern browsers require user interaction before audio plays
- The site already handles this - just click anywhere first
- Check browser console for autoplay policy errors
